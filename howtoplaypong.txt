How to play:

The player is the bottom paddle, the computer is the top paddle.

The game will start by launching a ball at the player. The player will move
their paddle with the left and right arrow keys, attempting to intercept the
ball before it hits the bottom boundary. 

If the player touches the ball with their paddle, it will bounce back towards 
to the computer's side of the screen. The computer will then attempt to do the 
same. This will continue until the ball hits the top or bottom of the screen, 
scoring a point for the opposing side.
